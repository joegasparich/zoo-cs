# Zoo Game

This is kind of meant to be a clone of Zoo Tycoon 1 but in the style of Prison Architect/Rimworld. It's not really intended to ever be released, I'm just writing it for fun.

The only dependency is [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) with [C# Bindings](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs), follow the guides on how to set it up.

This is the 5th time I've rewritten this lol
1. Unity
2. [Node JS](https://github.com/joegasparich/zoo-pixi)
3. [C++/OpenGL](https://github.com/joegasparich/zoo-cpp/tree/OpenGL)
4. [C++/Raylib](https://github.com/joegasparich/zoo-cpp)

I decided to rewrite this again pretty much entirely because I hated how verbose C++ is. It was a good learning experience getting to know C++, and understanding how OpenGL works, but I found it was taking too long to write, and C++ didn't have a lot of the language features that I enjoy.
